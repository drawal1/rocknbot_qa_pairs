Question: what are the cipher suites supported by RadiantOne v7.4?

Answer: To determine the cipher suites supported by the RadiantOne:
The default SSL/TLS protocol options are SSLv2Hello, SSL v3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2 and TLS v1.3. Some of the less secure protocols in this list are disabled by default in the <RLI_HOME>/jdk/jre/lib/security/java.security file, noted in the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms property.
Out of the available protocols, not in the disabled list, you can limit which ones you want RadiantOne to support. You can limit the protocols from the Main Control Panel > Settings Tab > Security section > SSL sub-section. Click Change next to Enabled SSL Protocols. Select the protocols to support and click OK. Restart the RadiantOne service on all nodes.
If you want to support one of the less secure protocols, edit the java.security file and remove the protocol from the jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms value. Then, make sure it is enabled in RadiantOne. Restart RadiantOne on all nodes. If a protocol is enabled in RadiantOne, but in the list of disabled algorithms in the java.security file, it will not be supported at runtime for SSL communication.

# Question/Answer Pair 17

Question: What are the possible capture types for Database Connectors in RadiantOne v7.4 Synchronization?

Answer: The possible capture types for Database Connectors in RadiantOne Synchronization are Changelog, Timestamp, and Counter. 

- Changelog: This connector type relies on a database table that contains all changes that have occurred on the base tables. Triggers or an external process can be used to write changes into the log/changelog table. The connector picks up changes from the changelog table.
- Timestamp: This connector type is validated against Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and Apache Derby databases. The database table must have a primary key and an indexed column that contains a timestamp/date value. This value must be maintained and modified for each updated record. The timestamp column type varies depending on the database used.
- Counter: This connector type is supported for any database table that has an indexed column containing a sequence-based value. The column must be one of the following types: BIGINT, DECIMAL, - INTEGER, or NUMERIC. The Counter connector uses this column to determine which records have changed since the last polling interval. It can also detect delete operations if the table has a dedicated "Change Type" column indicating insert, update, or delete.

# Question/Answer Pair 18

Question: What are the possible capture connector types for Active Directory in RadiantOne v7.4 Synchronization?

Answer: The possible capture connector types for Active Directory in RadiantOne Synchronization are DirSync, USNChanged, and Hybrid. 

The DirSync connector retrieves changes by passing a cookie that identifies the directory state at the time of the previous DirSync search. It stores a cookie in a cursor file when it is started and performs a DirSync search at the next polling interval to detect changes. This connector is recommended when the sequence of events is critical because it processes events in the order in which they occur.

The USNChanged connector keeps track of changes based on the uSNChanged attribute for the entry. It connects with the user and password configured in the connection string and checks the list of changes stored by Active Directory. It internally maintains the last processed change number (uSNChanged value) to recover all changes that occur, even if the connector is down.

The Hybrid connector uses a combination of the uSNChanged and DirSync change detection mechanisms. It gets a new cookie and the highest uSNChanged number when it starts. When it gets a new change, it makes an additional search using the DN of the entry and fetches the entry from AD. The fetched entry contains the uSNChanged attribute, so the connector updates the cursor values for both the cookie and the last processed uSNChanged number. This connector is suitable for virtualizing and detecting changes from a Global Catalog.

To select the desired connector type, access the Main Control Panel, Synchronization tab. Then choose the appropriate topology (on the left) and pipeline, and modify the connector type and advanced properties in the Capture component.

Question: What is Identity Linkage used for in RadiantOne v7.4 Synchronization?

Answer: Identity Linkage in RadiantOne Synchronization is used to establish a unique connection between a source identity and a target identity. This linkage can be based on a specific attribute or a combination of information computed with a function. By defining the identity linkage, you can ensure that the same logic is applied across all rules in RadiantOne Synchronization. However, if needed, each rule can have different criteria for identity linkage. The purpose of identity linkage is to accurately synchronize and match identities between different systems or data sources.

For more details, see: <https://developer.radiantlogic.com/idm/v7.4/global-sync-guide/configuration/rules/identity-linkage/>

# Question/Answer Pair 20

Question: How is the Target DN generated for RadiantOne v7.4 Synchronization?

Answer: The target DN for RadiantOne Synchronization can be generated automatically or manually. If you choose the Automatic option, the target DN is generated based on the virtual view created for the target and where it is mounted in the RadiantOne namespace. This option works well if you are synchronizing objects in the same container. However, if you need to sync entries into different containers or branches in the target, you should choose the Manual option.
When you select the Manual option, you will have a Target DN setting in your Rule. In this setting, you can choose the variable that contains the logic for how the target DN is generated. This allows you to have more control over the target DN generation process.
To summarize, if you want the target DN to be generated automatically based on the virtual view and mount location, choose the Automatic option. If you need more control and want to manually specify the target DN generation logic, choose the Manual option.

Question: How do I upgrade my RadiantOne version?

Answer: To upgrade your RadiantOne version:

Examples of an upgrade are moving from v7.2 to v7.3, v7.2 to v7.4, or v7.3 to v7.4. The upgrade process is not applied with an update installer and may require a professional services engagement to assess the current usage/configuration of RadiantOne to determine an appropriate upgrade strategy and time requirement. All customers currently running v7.2 and v7.3 where ICS/Synchronization is deployed should contact their Radiant Logic Account Representative to have their configuration reviewed and the scope/complexity of their upgrade path assessed. If a customer has only RadiantOne FID deployed (no ICS/Synchronization) and can upgrade their own deployment, they can leverage the upgrade guides available in the Radiant Logic Knowledge Base: [Radiant Logic Knowledge Base](<https://support.radiantlogic.com>).

1. Determine your current version: Check which version of RadiantOne you are currently using. This information will help you determine the appropriate upgrade path.

2. Access the upgrade guide: For example, you can find the upgrade guide for upgrading from version 7.2 to 7.4 at this link: [RadiantOne Upgrade Guide v7.2 to v7.4](<https://support.radiantlogic.com/hc/en-us/articles/7908444062612-RadiantOne-Upgrade-Guide-v7-2-to-v7-4>). This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to perform the upgrade.

3. Contact your Radiant Logic Account Representative: If you are using version 7.2 or 7.3 and require upgrade assistance, please reach out to your Radiant Logic Account Representative. They will be able to provide guidance and support for your specific upgrade needs.

Question: How do I initialize a RadiantOne v7.4 Directory store replica in another RadiantOne Cluster?

Answer: To initialize a RadiantOne Directory store replica in another RadiantOne Cluster, follow these steps:

1. Determine the leader node of the cluster by going to the Dashboard tab of the Main Control Panel. Look for the node marked as the leader (with a gold triangle).
2. If there are multiple clusters involved, export an LDIF file from the cluster considered the "master" image. Make sure the “Export for replication” option is enabled during the LDIF export.
3. Disable inter-cluster replication for the RadiantOne Directory store if you plan on re-initializing all replicas with a clean image. If you want to maintain inter-cluster replication and process changes from other replicas while re-initializing, do not disable inter-cluster replication.
4. Make sure to schedule a maintenance window for the re-initialization process, as it is time-consuming and requires the service to be offline.
5. On the Main Control Panel, go to the Directory Namespace tab and select the RadiantOne Directory store you want to initialize.
6. Click on the Initialize button on the Properties Tab.
7. Browse to the desired LDIF file and select it.
8. The initialization process will be executed on the leader node. The store on the leader node will be initialized and then activated again. The data will be copied to all follower/follower-only nodes.
9. If you have a large data set and multiple LDIF files, name the files with a suffix of "_2", "_3", etc., and make sure they are located in the same place for the initialization process to find them.
Please note that these instructions assume you are initializing the store on the leader node. If you attempt to initialize on a non-leader node, you will receive an error message indicating that you must perform this operation on a leader node.

Question: Where can I find the Identity Data Analysis tool in RadiantOne v7.4?

Answer: The Identity data analysis tool can be found in the \&lt;RLI_HOME\&gt;/bin/advanced directory. On Windows, it is named data_analysis.bat, and on Linux, it is named data_analysis.sh. To use the tool, you need to run it from a command prompt and provide the necessary arguments.
The required arguments are:
-d: The report directory where the report files will be saved. The report directory should not contain any path characters (/,\).
-f: The full name of the LDIF file you want to analyze. You can include the file path if needed.
Optional arguments are:
-h: Displays the help information.
-o: Allows you to overwrite files in the report directory. If you don't pass this option and the report directory already exists, no analysis will be done, and the report directory's files will not be changed.
-r: Removes detailed analysis files in the report directory.
Here's an example command to run the data analysis tool:
C:\radiantone\vds\bin\advanced\&gt;data_analysis.bat -d LDAPANALYSIS -f "C:\radiantone\vds\vds_server\ldif\export\ldap.ldif"
After running the tool, the reports will be generated in the specified report directory. In this example, the reports will be located in the following directory: C:\radiantone\vds\r1syncsvcs\profiler\LDAPANALYSIS.

Question: what is the role of sync engine in RadiantOne v7.4?

Answer: The role of the Sync Engine in RadiantOne v7.4 is to process attribute mappings and transformation scripts before sending events to the target endpoints. It acts as the central component that coordinates the synchronization process.
When changes occur in the data sources, the Sync Engine receives these changes from the queues. It then applies the necessary attribute mappings and transformation scripts to format the data correctly for the target endpoints. Once the data is transformed, the Sync Engine sends the events to the target endpoints for further processing.
The Sync Engine ensures that the synchronization process is efficient and accurate by handling the mapping and transformation of data. It plays a crucial role in maintaining data consistency and integrity between different systems.

Question: How does RadiantOne address challenges for implementing Zero Trust Architecture?

Answer: The identity system continues to decentralize and grow in complexity and volume, making it increasingly difficult for IT and security teams to combat cyber threats. Security control points are increasingly decentralized, but require real-time access to dispersed identity data to execute policies. Correlating and delivering that necessary data in the format required by each policy enforcement point is a prerequisite to Zero Trust Architecture. Implementation of practices like attribute-based access control requires a high-quality and rich set of information about each user to enforce security policy.
Identity-based controls are the modern way to secure the organization: but the hidden challenge is often delivering the identity data they require from across a complex infrastructure. Many organizations are dealing with identity sprawl:
- Identity data, including attributes for enforcing authorization, is dispersed
- Identity data might be stale, incomplete, or duplicative
RadiantOne addresses the requirement for access to high-quality identity data, delivering the required user context so that security policies can be precise.
- To deliver granular access control, complete and clean identity data is required
- Fine-grained authorization relies on access to detailed identity data
RadiantOne addresses identity complexity with integration, to:
- Deliver identity data that is: consistent, context-aware, and continuous
- Speed attribute-based access control with a unified source of identity data
- Reduce risk by implementing fine-grained authorization with many attributes
- Streamline compliance and audit with a 360-degree view of identity
- Decrease the attack surface, limit lateral movement, and prevent fraud

Question: How can I indicate to ignore logging events on specific naming contexts to avoid overloading log files with irrelevant events in RadiantOne v7.4?

Answer: To ignore logging for these naming contexts, expand below the Advanced section (requires Expert Mode) and check the box next to the naming context. Logging for the following naming contexts can be ignored.
- ROOT: this is for queries requesting the rootDSE (an empty base DN) and is often used by hardware load balancers to check the availability of the RadiantOne service.
- cn=changelog: modifications to entries in the RadiantOne namespace are tracked in the changelog. Other services can query the changelog frequently to check for changes.
- cn=clustermonitor: various statistics and availability of cluster nodes are retrieved by querying cn=clustermonitor.
- cn=replicationjournal: inter-cluster replication queries the cn=replicationjournal.

# Question/Answer Pair 47

Question: What is rli_router used for in RadiantOne?

Answer: The RadiantOne Access Router can be used in test environments where a hardware load balancer is not available. It was deprecated as of v7.3. In older versions of RadiantOne, it was used for load balancing or failover between multiple directories that contain the same structure. The directories could be virtual directories or any other LDAP-accessible server.
The access router works at the "packet" level, adding very little overhead to the system. It is an excellent way to aggregate throughput from many different servers, with the increase in throughput being linear up to about 10 LDAP servers. Any constraint in throughput is essentially linked to the processing and bandwidth of the machine where the router is running. Therefore, it is recommended to install the router on a machine where both bandwidth connectivity and processing can be dedicated to achieve the full benefits and performance.
All configuration information for the RadiantOne Access Router is stored in the `&lt;RLI_HOME&gt;/rlirouter/rli_router.conf` file, which is managed from the Router Administration Console.
The access router manages failover and load balancing at the level of the connection, not the operation. In a failover configuration, when a client establishes a connection, all operations are sent to the primary server. If an operation fails due to a loss of connection to the underlying LDAP server, the failover happens when the client re-opens the connection. The existing operation isn't automatically sent to the failover server. Only when the client re-connects will the connection be sent to the failover server.
During load balancing, all operations issued under the same connection are sent to the same underlying LDAP server. If a client application opens two connections, then one connection is sent to each underlying LDAP server.

Question: How do I remap foreign security principals returned in groups from Active Directory in v7.4?

Answer: 1. Create an LDAP proxy view for the primary Active Directory domain and then use a "merge tree" to merge in the Active Directory domain where the foreign security principals are located.
2. Select the proxy view node associated with the main Active Directory and on the Objects tab click ADD.
3. Select the group object and click OK.
4. Click Save and click Yes to confirm
5. At the bottom of the Objects tab, click EDIT next to Define Computed Attributes.
6. Click ADD.
7. Enter member for the attribute name.
8. Click FUNCTION to indicate the value of the member attribute should be computed with a function.
9. Select remapDN(attr2remap,dataSourceID,externalBaseDN,scope,externalIdAttr) and 
click OK. This function remaps a member value when the RDN value matches 
ObjectSID for a user entry. 
10. Select the member attribute from the attr2remp drop-down list.
11. Select the “vds” data source for the data source ID.
12. Check the External Base DN option and point to the branch in the virtual view where the 
users are located. (the merged tree location where the second Active Directory is mounted in step 1).
13. Enter ObjectSID for the externalIdAttr.
14. Click OK.
15. Click Validate.
16. Click OK and OK again to exit the Computed Attribute Window.
17. Click Save. 

With this remapping, any query containing a filter to look for a specific group returns the entry with the member attribute containing the DNs 
for the foreign user DN (e.g. CN=S-1-5-21-4199197291-1226998611-1231062227-1104,CN=ForeignSecurityPrincipals,o=delegated admin) translated into the actual user DN represented by the foreign security principal value (e.g. CN=Sally Europe,CN=User,o=delegated admin).

Question: How can client's query for a user's nested group memberships for entries stored in the RadiantOne directory v7.4?

Answer: Client's can search a RadiantOne directory for nested group members using LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN. The following example is used to describe the ability to search group membership for a user that is a member of a nested group.
User Ada Rule (identified with a DN of uid=Ada_Rule,ou=Administration,o=companydirectory) is a member of a group named WebUsers. The WebUsers group is a member of a group named Intern. The Intern group is a member of a group named AllUsers. Ada is implicitly a member of WebUsers, Intern and AllUsers. To query RadiantOne for a list of all groups Ada is a member of, the following filter leveraging the LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN OID can be used:
(uniquemember:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:=uid=Ada_Rule,ou=Administration,o=companydirectory)
